# Monkey Scripts
Userscripts I develop for quality of life improvements on sites I frequent.

## RIT MyCourses

MyCourses has a sidebar that displays upcoming events and assignments. These buttons don't allow you to ctrl + click or right click and open in new tab and most times I want to stay on the current page and open all my upcoming assignments. This script moves the button into view and attaches ```target="_blank"``` to it to allow this. I also styled it to fit with MyCourses' theme.
